    <p>Welcome! I'm Vedran, an 18-year-old high school student from Macedonia, and this is my personal homepage.
    Programming became my interest afer finishing primary school when I discovered the "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes and I've been doing it ever since. I've had my 
    fair share of hiccups along my journey but I finally feel like I am starting to get the point. Being young still, I want to explore
    all areas of programming. I've dedicated most of my time to back-end development mainly working with Python (Flask/FastAPI).  <br>
    
    <br>In addition to programming, I'm interested in Linux too. First I started with ubuntu and after messing with some other distributions as well
    I have decided to stick with arch, btw ;). My current setup consists of <b><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a></b> and <b><a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a></b>. I find the workflow much better compared to Windows since you're in control of your environment. All of my dotfiles are hosted at my <b><a href="https://github.com/vedranchi">Github</a></b>.
    <br>

    <br>Outside of the tech world I enjoy racing my bicycle, currently riding for my local club <b><a href="https://www.cyclingvelom.com/">Velo-M</a></b>,
    and also enjoy reading and playing piano.
