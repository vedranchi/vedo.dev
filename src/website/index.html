    <p>Welcome! I'm Vedran, an 18-year-old high school student from Macedonia, and this is my personal homepage.
    Programming became my interest afer finishing primary school and I've been doing it (not so productively) ever since. I've had my 
    fair share of hiccups during my journey but I finally feel like I am starting to get the point. Being young still I like to explore
    all areas of programming. I've dedicated most of my time to Python with Flask and FastAPI but I will not stop here :D. <br>
    
    <br>In addition to Programming, I'm interested in Linux too. First I started with ubuntu and after messing with some other distributions as well
    I have decided to stick with arch, btw ;). My current setup consists of <b><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a></b> and <b><a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a></b>. Great thing about using this setup is that all of my dotfiles are hosted at my <b><a href="https://github.com/vedranchi">Github</a></b>.
    <br>

    <br>Outside of the tech world I enjoy racing my bicycle, currently riding for my local club <b><a href="https://www.cyclingvelom.com/">Velo-M</a></b>
    And also enjoy reading, playing piano from time to time and going out occasionally.
